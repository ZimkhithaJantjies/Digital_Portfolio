# Career Counselling - Reflection (STAR)

**S – Situation:**  
During the Work Readiness Programme, I was introduced to the Career Counselling module. This module was designed to help me reflect on my academic journey, understand my goals, and begin identifying the kinds of roles I might enjoy in the ICT sector. Before this, I had only a general idea that I liked technology, but I wasn’t clear on the specific paths available.

**T – Task:**  
My task was to actively engage with all learning materials and activities in this module. I needed to research career paths in the ICT field, understand the roles and responsibilities associated with them, and match them to my own interests, personality, and future goals.

**A – Action:**  
I completed online learning units and interactive tasks that helped me discover different areas within ICT such as software development, data analysis, and UI/UX design. I also completed a self-evaluation worksheet to identify my own values, interests, and long-term ambitions. I had the opportunity to reflect on what I’m passionate about and what environment I would thrive in. The module ended with a one-on-one career counselling session, which helped me interpret my results and refine my career vision.

**R – Result:**  
Through this process, I discovered a strong interest in front-end development and user interface design — areas where my creativity, attention to detail, and communication skills can shine. I created an action plan for how to pursue this path through internships, further study, and personal projects. I scored 100% for this module and gained clarity and motivation for my future career.
