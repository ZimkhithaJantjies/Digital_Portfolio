# Create a CV - Reflection (STAR)

**S – Situation:**  
Toward the end of the programme, I was required to create a professional CV that could be used for real job applications. While I had basic knowledge of CVs from high school, I had never compiled a full document that reflects my growing skills and academic experience in ICT.

**T – Task:**  
The goal was to write a clean, professional CV that outlines my education, skills, and achievements. It had to be formatted in a way that would impress potential employers and pass through ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems).

**A – Action:**  
I researched modern CV templates and followed a layout that highlights my strengths. I wrote a short profile statement that introduces who I am, listed my diploma studies, added both technical and soft skills, and included relevant coursework and projects. I proofread my document multiple times and adjusted the structure for readability and professionalism.

**R – Result:**  
The result was a well-formatted CV that reflects both my personality and my readiness for the tech industry. It’s suitable for applying to internships and junior roles. I submitted the final version and scored 100%. This CV now gives me the confidence to apply to real opportunities.
