# CV Submission - Reflection (STAR)

**S – Situation:**  
The final part of the programme required me to submit the CV I created using the university’s online platform. It was essential that I followed instructions exactly and submitted a professional document before the deadline.

**T – Task:**  
Submit my completed CV through Blackboard in the correct format (PDF) and confirm the submission. This was a real-world simulation of submitting a CV to an employer.

**A – Action:**  
After reviewing and finalizing my CV, I exported it as a PDF and ensured it was named correctly. I logged into Blackboard, uploaded the file to the designated section, and verified that it was submitted successfully. I also took a screenshot for confirmation, just in case.

**R – Result:**  
My CV was submitted on time without any errors. I felt a sense of accomplishment knowing I had completed a real-world task professionally. I scored 100% and feel ready to submit applications to companies and internship programmes.
