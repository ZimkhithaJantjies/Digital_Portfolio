# Skills and Interests - Reflection (STAR)

**S – Situation:**  
As part of the second module in the Work Readiness Programme, I was asked to explore my skills and interests. While I had a sense of my academic strengths, I had not previously sat down to reflect deeply on how my skills could align with ICT job roles or how my hobbies might support my career direction.

**T – Task:**  
The goal was to complete structured self-assessments and matching exercises to identify my strongest skills and match them with suitable ICT roles. I was required to think critically about how my abilities, both technical and soft, relate to real-world job responsibilities.

**A – Action:**  
I filled out several digital worksheets and completed a skills inventory, ranking my abilities in areas like communication, teamwork, creative thinking, and technical knowledge. I also participated in an interest profiler that matched my personality to specific roles in tech. I reflected on previous school and project experiences to validate these skills.

**R – Result:**  
The process helped me realize I have a natural strength in creative problem-solving, organizing ideas, and working collaboratively. These align well with roles in UI/UX, front-end development, and even digital marketing. I scored 100% and now feel more confident in the direction I am heading, with a clear list of transferable skills I can build on.
