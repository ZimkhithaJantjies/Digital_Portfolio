# Personality Assessment - Reflection (STAR)

**S – Situation:**  
In the third module of the Work Readiness Programme, I was asked to complete a personality assessment. I had never done a formal personality test before, and I was curious about how my personality traits could affect my success and happiness in different ICT careers.

**T – Task:**  
The objective was to complete a validated personality questionnaire and interpret the results in the context of my potential workplace behavior, strengths, and career fit. I had to identify the kinds of environments I work best in and how I interact with others on teams.

**A – Action:**  
I responded honestly to all questions in the assessment. After receiving my personality profile, I read through the results carefully. I discovered that I am highly empathetic, observant, and innovative. I prefer working in supportive, structured environments that allow creative freedom. I compared my traits with common job role requirements and identified which careers matched my personality.

**R – Result:**  
The assessment showed that I am well-suited to roles that require both creativity and collaboration. This reinforced my interest in UX design, software testing, and business analysis. I also learned that I enjoy solving problems from the user’s perspective. I achieved a perfect score and gained valuable insight that I can use when building my personal brand and CV.
